           <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Nikola Tesla life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1856</strong> - Born in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (Croatia these days)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1870</strong> - Tesla's first years of education took place in schools in Smiljan and Gospic, and secondary education (corresponding to high school) he did in Karlovac. Studies in Karlovac began in 1870 and lasted until 1873.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1875</strong> - Tesla studied engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic Institute in Graz starting in 1875. After studying three years on the engineering course, Tesla decided to drop it and did not obtain his degree. This profoundly affected his relationship with his family.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1881</strong> - Tesla started working at a telephone company in Budapest, Hungary, and was eventually promoted to chief electrician.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1882</strong> - The following year, he moved to Paris, France, where he started working at the Continental Edison Company, Thomas Edison's company. He was hired as an engineer, and soon his skill caught attention.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1884</strong> - Tesla was transferred to the United States on the recommendation of an old boss of his in Paris. He arrived in the United States in June, going to work at the Edison Machine Works, in New York. He received the mission to perfect 24 machines company, and was promised a $50,000 bonus if he succeeded. Tesla worked for six months at the Edison Machine Works, and after he discovered that the company had no intention of paying him the promised bonus, he quit. During that period, he worked 18 hours a day, and that ( work compulsively) was his lifelong practice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1887</strong> - Nikola Tesla invented an electric motor that worked by electromagnetic induction. As we will see, this motor worked by alternating currents and proved to be simple, practical and easy to maintain. The following year, Tesla sold the patent for his invention to George Westinghouse, owner of Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1893</strong> - Alternating current, used and defended by Tesla, increased the power of electrical transmission, and the system developed by him allowed the electrical energy produced to travel over long distances. The alternating energy system used by Tesla obtained, a contract to build a hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls. This plant was being built to supply electricity to Buffalo, but it distributed electricity to other locations, such as Boston and Toronto, Canada. The inauguration and success of the plant in the falls made the alternating energy system consolidate in the United States as default. This ended the war of currents.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1901</strong> - After the success with the alternating current electric motor, Tesla moved on with other projects. This year, he started a project to transmit electrical energy without the need for wires. began his studies in a laboratory in New York. His attempt failed, as he was unable to carry out the transmission of electrical energy without wires. However, scientists say that such a project allowed the creation of objects, such as remote control, and that technologies, such as wireless internet, were possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1922</strong> - The failure led Tesla to bankruptcy, and he had to leave the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, where he lived for 22 years. From 1922 to 1934 he lived in hotels in New York, and in all of them he left bills to be paid. In 1934, he began receiving a pension from his former company, the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1943</strong> - Nikola Tesla died on January 7, 1943. He was in his room at the New Yorker Hotel, and it is believed that the cause of death would have been heart problems. Tesla never married and had no children.
